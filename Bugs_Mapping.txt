Wrong operator: Changed the bitwise operator from `^` (XOR) to `&` (AND) to correctly count set bits.
Loop condition logic: Changed the loop condition to check if all incoming nodes of the next node are in the ordered nodes, instead of checking outgoing nodes, to ensure nodes are added in the correct topological order.
Variable misuse: Renamed methods `successor`, `successors`, and `predecessors` to `get_successor`, `get_successors`, and `get_predecessors` to avoid naming conflicts with class attributes.
Conditional block omission: Added an `equal` list to handle elements equal to the pivot, preventing infinite recursion when the input array contains duplicate elements.
Wrong function call: Corrected the recursive call to yield the element directly when it's not a list.
Expression modification: Corrected the Floyd-Warshall algorithm by changing `length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]` to `length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]` to correctly calculate shortest path lengths.
Incorrect return statement: Reversed the output string to return the correct base conversion.
Incorrect function condition: Added a condition to return an empty list if k is greater than the range size or a is greater than b, and changed the return statement when k==0 from `return []` to `return [[]]`.
Loop boundary error: Modified the loop to iterate only through the unsorted portion of the array, preventing re-insertion of already-sorted elements.
Comparison logic error: Changed condition from '<' to '>' to find the correct element for swapping in the next permutation in the next_permutation function.
Incorrect function condition: Changed condition from `len(arr) == 0` to `len(arr) <= 1` to handle the base case when the array has one element in mergesort.
Exception handling bug: Added try-except block to handle IndexError and swapped the order of operands to correctly evaluate the RPN expression, handling malformed RPN expressions.
Operator omission: Added `lines.append(text)` after the while loop to include the remaining text after the wrapping process.
Incorrect function condition: Changed condition from `if n <= 0` to `if n <= 1` to handle the base case when n is 1 in the factorial function.
